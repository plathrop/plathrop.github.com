Take advantage of over ten years of professional systems engineering
experience; practicing DevOps before it became a buzzword, designing
and supporting infrastructures at scales ranging from the tens to the
hundreds of systems, and living my passion for automation,
collaboration, measurement, transparency, and communication.

    programming, declarative programming.
  * Training and practical experience with agile development
    methodologies and their application to systems engineering teams;
